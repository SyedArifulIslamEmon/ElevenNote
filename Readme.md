About Eleven Fifty
-----------
Eleven Fifty is an immersive coding academy where you will build and ship three apps to the AppStore in just one week!

We donâ€™t waste valuable classroom instruction time teaching you to draw circles, create things by hand that the Integrated Development Environment will do for you, or build apps that nobody in their right mind would ever use. Instead, we teach you how to build apps that you already use every day. We start with the simplest parts of a project, such as the login screen, and then progressively dig deeper, exposing our students to the most important portions of the frameworks.
